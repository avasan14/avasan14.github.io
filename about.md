Hi, my name is Ashwin Vasan. I am currently a 4th year Financial Actuarial Math and Statistics student at UCLA.

## More information

I am going to work in Actuarial Consulting after I graduate in June 2022. I look forward to applying some of the great python skills that I will be learning in this class to my future work!
