title: Advanced Data Analysis using Web Scraping Tools
---

I will be using webscraping in order to answer the following question: ***What movie or TV shows share actors with your favorite movie or show?*** The idea of this question is that, if TV show Y has many of the same actors as TV show X, and you like X, you might also enjoy Y. Thus, this tutorial could provide a method for finding different recommendations of movies/shows to watch in the future! My favorite movie is Inglourious Basterds, so I will be creating this tutorial using this movie as reference! The main libraries I will be using in order to perform this analysis are `scrapy`, `pandas`, and `seaborn`. Here is my project repository that contains my code for the webscraping: https://github.com/avasan14/Hw2-WebScrape.

## Writing my Scraper

To write my scraper, I created a file inside the `spiders` directory called `imdb_spider.py`. Within this file, I created a class with three important methods. We will now explore those further.

### Implementation of parse() method

The first method I wrote is the parse() method. parse(self, response) assumes that we start on a movie page, and then navigate to the All Cast & Crew page. It is important to note that this page has url <movie_url>fullcredits. Once there, the parse_full_credits(self,response) method is called by specifying it in the callback argument to a yielded scrapy.Request. The parse() method does not return any data.

```python
def parse(self, response):
        '''
        Navigates from the movie page to the All Cast & Crew page. There is no data output.
        '''
        # since page has url with "fullcredits", this is what we search for to go to all cast and crew link
        all_cast_and_crew = response.css("[href^=\"fullcredits\"]").attrib["href"]
        # join this tag with the original url to move to the all cast and crew page
        all_cast_and_crew = response.urljoin(all_cast_and_crew)
        # yield scrapy.Request with full credits
        yield scrapy.Request(all_cast_and_crew, callback = self.parse_full_credits)
```
### Implementation of parse_full_credits() method

The next method I wrote is the parse_full_credits() method. parse_full_credits(self, response) assumes that we start on the All Cast & Crew page. Its purpose is to yield a scrapy.Request for the page of each actor listed on the page. Note that crew members are not included. The yielded request should specify that the method parse_actor_page(self, response) should be called when the actor’s page is reached. The parse_full_credits() method does not return any data. 

```python
def parse_full_credits(self, response):
        '''
        Extracts the entire cast from the All Cast & Crew page. Yields a scrapy.Request for the page of each actor listed in the All Cast & Crew page. There is no data output.
        '''
        # create a list of relative paths, one for each actor: This command mimics the process of clicking on the headshots on this page.
        cast = [a.attrib["href"] for a in response.css("td.primary_photo a")]
        # reset the response url to imdb.com
        response = response.replace(url = "https://www.imdb.com")
        # for each actor within the full cast, join urls to navigate to the actor's imdb page and then yield a scrapy.Request for that page
        for actor in cast:
            actor = response.urljoin(actor)
            yield scrapy.Request(actor, callback = self.parse_actor_page)
```
### Implementation of parse_actor_name() method

The final method I wrote in my scraper is the parse_actor_name() method. parse_actor_page(self, response) assumes that we start on the page of an actor. It yields a dictionary with two key-value pairs, of the form {"actor" : actor_name, "movie_or_TV_name" : movie_or_TV_name}. The method yields one such dictionary for each of the movies or TV shows on which that actor has worked. 

```python
def parse_actor_page(self, response):
        '''
        Starts on the page of an actor. Yields a dictionary with the actor's name and the corresponding movie/show they appeared in by extracting it from the filmography section.
        '''
        # extract the actor name, filmography section, and all the movies and shows that they were in
        actor_name = response.css("span.itemprop::text").get()
        filmography = response.css("div.filmo-row")
        movie_or_TV = filmography.css("b a::text").getall()
        # for each movie/show, yield the dictionary with the actor's name and the corresponding movie/show they worked in
        for movie_or_TV_name in movie_or_TV:
            yield {
                "actor" : actor_name,
                "movie_or_TV_name" : movie_or_TV_name
            }
```
## Making my Recommendations

Once the scraper is completely written, run the following line of code
```python
scrapy crawl imdb_spider -o movies.csv
```
in order to run the spider and save a CSV file called movies.csv, with columns for actor names and the movies and TV shows on which they worked. Once the CSV file is created, we want to read it in and create a visualization. We will use `pandas`, `numpy`, and `seaborn` to prepare our data and create our visualization. First, we read in the movies.csv file by running this code:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
movies = pd.read_csv("movies.csv")
movies
```
<div>
<style scoped>
    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {
        vertical-align: middle;
    }

    .dataframe tbody tr th {
        vertical-align: top;
    }

    .dataframe thead th {
        text-align: right;
    }
</style>
<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th></th>
      <th>actor</th>
      <th>movie_or_TV_name</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>0</th>
      <td>Jasper Linnewedel</td>
      <td>Inglourious Basterds</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>1</th>
      <td>Salvadore Brandt</td>
      <td>Heartbeat</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>2</th>
      <td>Salvadore Brandt</td>
      <td>Sushi in Suhl</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>3</th>
      <td>Salvadore Brandt</td>
      <td>Europas letzter Sommer</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>4</th>
      <td>Salvadore Brandt</td>
      <td>Das blaue Licht</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>...</th>
      <td>...</td>
      <td>...</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>10191</th>
      <td>Michael Fassbender</td>
      <td>60 Minutes</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>10192</th>
      <td>Michael Fassbender</td>
      <td>Celebrity Page</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>10193</th>
      <td>Michael Fassbender</td>
      <td>Made in Hollywood</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>10194</th>
      <td>Michael Fassbender</td>
      <td>Chelsea Lately</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>10195</th>
      <td>Michael Fassbender</td>
      <td>1st AACTA Awards</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>10196 rows × 2 columns</p>
</div>

Then, we want to compute a sorted list with the top movies and TV shows that share actors with Inglourious Basterds. We do this by running the following code: 

```python
# groups by movies and creates column with total number of shared actors
shared = movies.groupby(["movie_or_TV_name"]).aggregate(len)
# reset indices and sorts by number of shared actors descending order, only taking the top 10
df = shared.sort_values(by = ["actor"], ascending = False).reset_index().head(10)
# rename columns
df = df.rename({"movie_or_TV_name": "movie","actor": "number of shared actors"}, axis = 1)
df
```

<div>
<style scoped>
    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {
        vertical-align: middle;
    }

    .dataframe tbody tr th {
        vertical-align: top;
    }

    .dataframe thead th {
        text-align: right;
    }
</style>
<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th></th>
      <th>movie</th>
      <th>number of shared actors</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>0</th>
      <td>Inglourious Basterds</td>
      <td>99</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>1</th>
      <td>Tatort</td>
      <td>27</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>2</th>
      <td>The Oscars</td>
      <td>21</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>3</th>
      <td>Entertainment Tonight</td>
      <td>17</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>4</th>
      <td>Police Call 110</td>
      <td>16</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>5</th>
      <td>Grindhouse</td>
      <td>16</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>6</th>
      <td>Django Unchained</td>
      <td>16</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>7</th>
      <td>Saturday Night Live</td>
      <td>15</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>8</th>
      <td>Extra with Billy Bush</td>
      <td>14</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>9</th>
      <td>Today</td>
      <td>13</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>

Once the dataframe is created, we can create a barplot to visualize the top 10 movies/shows with the most shared actors with Inglourious Basterds.

```python
import seaborn as sns
sns.barplot(x = "number of shared actors",
            y = "movie",
            data = df).set(title = "Top 10 Movies/TV Shows with most shared actors with Inglourious Basterds")
```
![sns_barplot_movies.png](/images/sns_barplot_movies.png)
    
As expected, Inglourious Basterds shares the most actors with Inglourious Basterds. It is interesting to me that there are many talk shows/award shows that share actors as well. This likely indicates that Inglourious Basterds has a relatively high profile cast. Finally, what stands out to me is the similarity with Django Unchained because both were directed by Quentin Tarantino and are known to be relatively similar, well-respected movies.
