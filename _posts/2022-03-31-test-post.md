## Math
$$f(x) = e^x$$

## Code
To create a larger block of code, use three consecutive backticks ``` to both open and close the code block. If you place the word python immediately after the opening code blocks, youâ€™ll get attractive syntax highlighting:

``` python
def f(x):
    """
    A cool function that multiples an input x by 2. 
    """
    return 2*x
```

You can leave off the python syntax highlighting in order to distinguish between code and code output, which is usually not highlighted:

``` python
print("to boldly go")
```
```
to boldly go
```
